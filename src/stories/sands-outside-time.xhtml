<br />
Thou openest thine eyes to an unfamiliar, sandy vista. It is silent, aside from the sound of a cool breeze, and the air hath no notable scent. Thou checkest thy belongings. With thee is thy rugged explorer attire, an old wide-brimmed hat and a similarly time-worn backpack. It must be twenty years since thou boughtest thy cheap outfit. Thou wert only thirty at the time, and thy budget was far from generous. Nevertheless, it turned out to be surprisingly sturdy, surviving this long with few repairs.<br />
<br />
Standing up, thou brushest off the irritating dust, much of it refusing to leave thy clothes. Ignoring the unpleasant sensation, thou gazest towards the horizon, noticing nought but the sun, peering wanly ouer the land. It appears to be dawn, or mayhaps dusk. The two are difficult to distinguish as the star remains stationary. The lukewarm ground is bathed in an eerie orange glow, which provideth a mild feeling of comfort despite its ominous aura. Though the arid air drieth thy mouth instantly, thy thirst is strangely absent. Common wisdom saith that thou shouldest drink regardless, but thy rough hands do not reach for thy backpack. Instead, thy mind goeth vacant, and thy body stumbleth forward, as if drawn by an unseen force.<br />
<br />
The sand makes a soft, rustling noise beneath thy feet, accompanying thy dazed stroll through the desert. Every instance of the sound reinforceth the omnipresent dreamy feeling. Some time passeth. Thy mind beareth no recollection of the exact length, and thy legs accumulate no exhaustion. One may only assume that many hours had gone by.<br />
<br />
At last, a dark shape emerges in the distance - a pyramid, its smooth and unyielding sides couered in dancing symbols of indescribable colour. Its monolithic form loometh ouer, beckoning thee with an almost hypnotic allure. Unable to resist its call, thou walkest closer. Thy pace is uneven and staggering, yet it mattereth not. Nothing mattereth in the face of this maiesty. Yes, nothing mattereth as long as thou climbest to the top of this pyramid. Yet as thou drawest nearer, thy stomach churneth. The angles of the pyramid are wrong, impossibly so, and its sinister silhouette appeareth to shift and change, seemingly welcoming thine approach. It is as if this masonic behemoth is alive. Though thou canst not hear it, thou art certain that an otherworldly heartbeat reverberateth within. Thy mind drowneth in terror, failing to grasp the eldritch geometry comprising the pyramid&#x27;s form. With a start, thou turnest to flee, the ancient tomb fading behind thee. Ah, if only thou wert strong enough to continue walking, if only thou couldest reach that wonder! Frightened by these thoughts, thou shunnest them, quickening thy desperate escape to a sprint.<br />
<br />
In the corners of thine eyes, thou seest more bizarre structures, - peculiar towers scraping the skies, oases with mesmerising exotic flora, tiny irregular huts which appear bigger on the inside - each of them prolonging thy hurried flight. After a while, thy panic subsideth, and thou collapsest to the floor. Thy fatigue is not physical, but mental in nature. Thou surveyest thy surroundings, pleased to find no unusual sights. The sand feeleth soothingly normal, which calmeth thy nerves slightly. Several gusts of wind hit thine ageing face, offering a similar solace. Thy scar-couered hands tremble while playing with the sand.<br />
<br />
The moment of relief passeth, giving way to a storm of whispers. They swirl around thee, speaking in tongues foreign to man and even the universe itself. Thine unconscious mind strains to comprehend the incessive chants and obscure narratives, catching glimpses of forbidden knowledge. Accounts of ancient civilisations, tales of realms beyond the cosmos, and hidden prayers to beings of unfathomable wisdom and power flood thy mind, and with each word spoken by these abominable voices, thy sanity frays. Thou hast not the urge to run or close thine ears, for this ouerwhelming cacophony seems to permeate deep through thy mind, almost appearing to come from within. The noxious dissonance subsides, yet the incomprehensible utterances continue to course through thy head.<br />
<br />
After another period of walking, the landscape twists and warps before thee once more, revealing an abandoned city of cyclopean stone structures. Their towering forms bend and contort as if in agonising pain. At times neighbouring buildings would couer the sky, arching together, and in the next moment they would be far apart, letting gloomy half-light shine through. Following along one of the streets, thou spottest an alley with a shimmering light of an obscure source. Curious, thou turnest towards it, yet the narrow passage proves difficult to enter as the corners collide with thee from a distance, behaving in ways in which regular matter never should. Unwilling to experiment with the alien geometry further, thou approachest an intersection of several broader avenues. Staying close to the centre of one of these pathways, thou passest through with ease. Although thy mind still reeleth in the midst of these moving shapes, the accompanying vertigo hath somewhat subsided.<br />
<br />
Thine excursion through this queer cityscape continues. For the first time, thou realisest that the surrounding stone structures have some strange kind of doors and windows. They mix seamlessly with the walls, seemingly afraid of ruining the perfect façades. Certain buildings differ markedly from others, their colours somehow brighter than usual. Thou canst only assume that this distinction serveth as an indicator to their purpose. The incomprehensible profoundness of the designs fascinateth thee, inciting a sense of admiration and reverence for the race that once populated these streets. This must be the pinnacle of architecture, a marvellous and unachievable peak of technology. Thou blinkest once, and the colossal city vanisheth without a trace, much to thy displeasure.<br />
<br />
Above this land, beyond mortal perception, floateth the bloated corpus of an Old One. Ancient symbols crawl and morph across its body, hinting at secrets untold. Its appendages bend and undulate in unthinkable ways, both immeasurably far and unbelievably close to every possible point in space. Its eyes, piercing and all-seeing, couer the desolation with a cold, uncaring gaze, its void-like depth reminiscent to that of the vast cosmos. The futile venture across this timeless desert, too, lieth within its view. Unknown to the unfortunate traveller, the unforgiving grasp of this realm releaseth none.<br />
